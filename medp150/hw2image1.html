		This image is of the Dover Patrol Monument at John Paul Johnes park in Bayridge, Brooklyn. As kids and even today the people who live around here just refer to it as "Cannonball park" because of the decomishined old cannon and cannon balls that lay there. The monument is a memorial towards a British naval battle during the second world world, ironic considering there is also another monument in the park, a rock with a metal plaque to commemorate the first resistance made towards British arms in the August of 1776. The compositional ideas I used to make this image was the symmetry of the trees that stand besides the monument, the trees also create a frame for the monument and the thin branches on top give the monument an almost cracked look to it. I adjusted the saturation of the image to really bring out the redish brown bark of the trees and and to bring out the rust forming on the monument, there is something strangly appealing to me about this look.
