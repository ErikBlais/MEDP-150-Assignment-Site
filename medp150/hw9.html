<p>To make this image I used several creatures from the paintings of famous 15th century Dutch painter Heironymus Bosch, copyright laws covers a painters work up to 70 after the painters death, after which it isn in the public domain, considering that Bosch was born before such laws were made and died 500 years ago, I'm pretty sure its free use, I found most of his works on public domain websites. I came up with the idea spontaneously after lecture class. The background photo is my front porch and the monsters come from varying Bosch works, they all march down into mouth of the largest one. After all the monsters where in place I painted a shadow under each of them using a dark grey color on low opacity on the multiply blending mode. I selected the sky and applied a selective color to change the blue color of the sky to a yellowish green, then on the same selection of the sky and applying another selective color to change all the white of the clouds to purple. After this I combed through the photo one more time with the paint brush to paint over all the green from the grass and trees and flowers into a pinkish color using the overlay blending mode. I was going for a surreal dream world sense sort of like the the childrens book 'Where the Wild Things are'.</p>

<p>To make this image I used a picture of a mountain as well as a peacock from Pexels, then I got a picture of what looks like some kind of colorful rock or something from Flickr. I used the picture of the mountains as a base then I selected the sky and created a mask with the picture of the colorful rock on the vivid light blending mode. I like how it looks like the sky bleeds onto the mountains, then I made a selection of the dots on the peacocks feathers because they look like eyes to me and masked everything else besides them out and apply the linear light blending mode. After this I applied a color balance and hue/saturation layers to the peacock eyes selection. Sometimes when I look directly up at night I get vertigo, I feel like I'm falling, its like I remembered we're on such a small rock flying through space.</p>
