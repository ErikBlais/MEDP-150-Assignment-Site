		This is an image of a gazebo at the same John Paul Jones park. Growing up in this neighborhood I've seen many wedding pictures and parties taken in this gazebo, as well as picnics and even some fond memories of my own with my friends in there. The compositional ideas I used to take this photo was the rule of thirds to manage to get the gazebo in the bottom right corner while still managing to get the Verazanno Bridge in the shot. In this image I boosted the yellow filter to make the gazebo draw the attention more, as well as increased the saturation which really helped to bring out the Verazanno's baby blue colored steel.
