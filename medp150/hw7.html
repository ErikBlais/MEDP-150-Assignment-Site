<p>I agree with the title of the article, counter-culture hasnt dissapeared, you're just not likely to see it on the internet. However, counter-culture is a very abstract thing, what is counter-culture today is regualr culture tomorrow. True counter-culture is always shifting with the tastes of the bigger culture.  Also most thing people would consider counter-culture, is really a sub-culture of something else, the example the arrticle gave was Six-Nine, but i belive its apparent is most media we consume.</p>

<p>I didn't have any good dynamic photos of my friends that I could move around so instead I used this image of a dogs face on a shark I made in Photoshop about a year ago and used the puppet warp on it instead. The dogs face is from a meme called "Walter".</p>
