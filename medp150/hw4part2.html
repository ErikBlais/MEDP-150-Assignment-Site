	<p>To create this pattern I used the principles of mainly symmetrical balance, contrasting colors as well as rhythm. First, I started with a square with a purple stroke, then another smaller square with a green fill. After this I made a triangle in each of the corners of the square with a red fill. When I was finished with the pattern I still had two white lines on either side, I didn't want to leave the empty white space, so I found an image of some red and white warning stripes that I thought help fill the white space, and match with the colors.</p>
