		In the article, How Nothingness Became everything we Wanted by Kyle Chayka, I agree with his general statement. I do notice that in mainstream culture, maybe specifially meme culture. Chayka mentions how terms like "smoothbrain" did start out as derogatory terms to insult someones intelligence, with everything going on in the world it has since become a sign of being tougher or funnier for being apatheic to the problems of the world. However I do think the author is stretching a bit in terms of products reflecting this. He mentions the rise of CBD drinks and the popularity of the alcoholic drink WhiteClaws and tries to relate it this theme, which misses for me. He also mentions how the COVID pandemic has led to an inclination to stay home and watch Netflix or play video games, But of coursew it would, these mediums have been a popular form of escapism for a while and now in a global pandemic where your government leaders are telling you to minimalize contact with others. I also completely disagree with Chayka implying that this isolastion has led to an increase in the country's divisivness and racism. I belive it has more to do with rising tensions between classes within America and its own original sin, slavery.
