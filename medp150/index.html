		There is a famous quote I like thats quite cliche, but I think its very relevant to what I appreciate the most about art. In an interview in 2014 about his book The Future of the Mind, theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku said "The human brain has 100 billion neurons, each neuron connected to 10,000 other neurons. Sitting on your shoulders is the most complicated object in the known universe". The most interesting part of stories and art to me is the philosophical and psychological aspect inherent to all art, when looking at art from antiquity Id like to try and imagine the possible life experiences of a person who lived thousands of years ago, their unique view on life and personal beliefs of a person that led them to create this thing. I find that even though our world are thousands of years apart their insight can still be valuable today. I also enjoy more psychological stories, the questions that these stories bring up like the line between sanity and insanity, what is truly good and truly evil? These kind of stories lend themselves to a "meatier" story that you notice new things within each viewing or find a hidden deeper meaning. I also try to practice basic color theory in my art, I appreciate when strong shading or highlighting, and the use of color can be used to draw out certain emotions within people. I am not a "true" artist you could say but what I hope to achieve in my colors is to bring out the same emotions that filled me when I first saw the art.
