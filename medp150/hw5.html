<p>This poster that I made is based off the poster for the 1939 World's Fair in New York. In the Posters for the ones set in New York there alwasy seems to be these recurring shapes of an obelisk and a shpere usually also with the line "The World of Tomorrow" or the line "The City of Light". These structures represent the Trylon and the Perisphere, which are two giant structures built in the modernist style by the architects Wallace Harrison and J. Andre Fouilhoux. They were a temporary structure built for the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows Park in Queens and as a result became the Themes center. World War 2 began 4 months into the 1939 World's Fair, as a result many structures were scrapped shortly after, Including the Trylon and Perisphere. I used a very retro kind of font called Broadway, that helps keep that old school feeling. For the text I didn't just want to fill the space on top with all the text information because I had other plans for that space, so I used the space in the Perisphere. "Hunter College" is in the schools purple color that also matches the color used as the darker part of the sky gradient. The colors I choose are also based off the poster below. </p>
