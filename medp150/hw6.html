	<p>To create the first pattern, I used a custom color scheme from an image on my computer. Once I had my color scheme, I created a series of lines which each line having the color fill of one of the colors. After this I copied all the dashes and pasted them again on top, then I slightly shifted the copy layer so they are overlapping each other. The colors are a mix of flesh tones and composite colors that are strangely striking. This design could be printed very small and put on clothing or something of the sort. For the second pattern its compound color scheme I call “Rainbow sherbet”, which is one of my favorite flavors of ice cream in Baskin Robbins, my dad introduced it to me. Its sweet like fruit with little pieces of pulp but also very creamy like ice cream should be. Anyway, the color is exactly the same as the ice cream, so it gave me a nice nostalgic feeling from my childhood. At first the design of the of the second pattern was to be a flower. First, I created a circle as the center and used the line tool and the curvature tool to create the petals of the flower. As I began to color in the flower it started to resemble an atom or something more than flower, that’s when I created the oval shape using two curved lines and give it the appearance of electrons flying around it.</p>
